# Welcome to my Personal Website !

This website was made with [Astro](https://astro.build), check out the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build) for more information.

I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling. I also reused some components from my [previous website](https://github.com/Eliaz-LR/Personal-website-v2) made with Vue.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

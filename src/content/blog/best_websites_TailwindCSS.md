Honestly, this first article is mainly for me to test the whole process of publishing an article and to showcase the article system ~~I made from scratch with Vue.~~ *\[Update : I now use Astro for this website with it's [content collection system](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)\]* I'm not sure if I'll keep this article or not, but I'll leave it here for now.

As a beginner with TailwindCSS development, I found making components from scratch pretty hard. Thankfully I ended up finding some really good pre-made components websites. I used these to help myself getting a headstart when making components.

Anyways here's the list of components websites I found:

- [HyperUI](https://www.hyperui.dev/)

  This is the main one I would recommend, you don't have anything to add to your project, just copy and paste the code and you're good to go. It's also really well organized and has a lot of components.

- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
  
  This is a really nice library with a lot of components. ~~I haven't used it yet, but it looks pretty good still.~~ *\[Update : It is now the main library I use for the TailwindCSS friendly components on this website. It's feature I leverage the most is probably it's theme system although the default one need some customization as they lack contrast and therefore visibility in my opinion.\]*

title: Switching from Vue to Astro
description: What switching from Vue to Astro changed for my website

## Why I switched

For my portfolio website 2.0, I choosed to use Vue as my main framework. I had already worked with Vue on my internship at [RGU](https://www.rgu.ac.uk/), so I was already familiar with it.

However, I've had a lot of changes I wanted to make to my website. I wanted to make it have multiple themes like what I did with Lyrical Bomb and to change the projects card component to make them show the technologies used as a link.

Those changes would have probably stayed on the backburner for a while if I didn't stumble upon [Astro](https://astro.build/). Astro's promise is to make static websites way faster utilizing server side hydration and good old HTML. The best way to make a website fast is by loading as little things as possible and, while switching from a single page app to a multi page app isn't always ideal, for my website where users don't load a lot of pages, it's perfect.

## What switching changed

The first thing that Astro promises is to make your website faster.
